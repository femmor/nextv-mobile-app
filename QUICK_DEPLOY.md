## Next Steps

### 1. Create Developer Accounts

- **Apple Developer Account**: $99/year at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
- **Google Play Console**: $25 one-time at [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)

### 2. Start with Preview Build

This creates internal builds you can test on devices without going through store review.

### 3. Test Your App

- Download preview builds to test on real devices
- Share with beta testers
- Fix any issues before production build

### 4. Production Build & Submit

```bash
# When ready for stores
npm run build:all
# Then after builds complete
npm run submit:all
```

## Important Notes

### Before First Build

2. Your backend API should be deployed and accessible
3. Test your app thoroughly in development

### Store Requirements

- **App Store**: Need app description, screenshots, privacy policy
